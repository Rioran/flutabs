# flutabs - Flute tabulatures
Harvard CS50 project: recorder (block flute) tabulatures interface.

Interface published on https://rioran.github.io/flutabs/

Based on my [hobby article](https://vas3k.club/idea/27765/) idea in Russian language

### Features

- visually construct a melody in a recorder friendly format - common notes notation simplified
- share your melody with others by serializing it into semitones number format
- load melodies from others using input field for semitones number format
- traspose melodies by a number of semitones
- auto columns prolongation when user adds edge note

### Controls

- click grid cells to either assign a note ⬤, change it to a flat note ◀ or to clear whole column
- use button to add octaves if needed
- use button to add columns to the right

### TODO

- tell more about FluTabs in English
- more controls for track (like insert columns anywhere)
- allow user comments
